## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the musician.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find new music that have been relisted.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly music.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new music video.
        3. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used are black, purple, green and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Lato and Oswald font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fall-back font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
